Analysis of Experiments for DePaul's Social Network Analysis Class (DSC480)

This Repo includes the social network analysis of an imaginary scenario (created by me) using R in R markdown format. 

You may find the complete list of interactions in the repository (https://github.com/ar7emiy/SocialNetworkAnalysisExperiments/blob/main/Final_NexusOKO_network.pdf).
Give it a read... there's some wild drama as it is in every startup.

It is divided into three parts:
- initial interactions of Nexus.AI
- Merger with Oko.AI to create NexusOko.AI
- Change of upper management


The midterm assessment code covers the social network changes through various visualizations of the network, clustering of network nodes, as well as individual node analysis which allows to "stress-test" the network.

The final assessment code covers the changes seen from change of management. This includes similar visualizations using in the midterm, but also includes Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) analysis of the network.
